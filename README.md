**mikhil_model_v1**
This code has the Machine Learning model for predicting the cancer is Benign or Malignant from using the dataset Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic).
Some basic data preprocessing like the removal of highlt correlated features in the dataset is done.
The dataset is splitted into train and test in the ratio 4:1.
Decision Tree Classifier is used to predict the cancer type in this version.
The accuracy has been found to be 91% on the test dataset.

**mikhil_model_v2**
This is the upated code with a different Machine Learning model.
Random Forest Classifer is used for the prediction in this version.
The accuracy has found to be increased to 96% compared to the previous model.
